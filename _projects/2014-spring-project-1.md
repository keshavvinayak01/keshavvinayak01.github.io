Summary
======

Summarized the performance and micro-architecture of Intel/AMD processors on SPEC FP and INT Benchmarks of 2017 using perf and hardware counters. Used Normalized Cycle count, IPC, Branch Prediction Performance, L2 Data TLB hit rate, L2 cache
performance, percentage wasted work as metrics for a detailed comparison analysis. Also designed a micro-benchmark
aimed at maximizing branch mispredictions that achieved a miss rate of 33%.
