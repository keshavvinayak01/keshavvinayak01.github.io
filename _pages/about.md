I'm (About to be) a Member of Technical Staff @ [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/), where I (Explain about your work). Previously, I was a grad student @ [Department of Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/)<b> , IISc Bangalore</b>, where I was advised by [Prof Arkaprava Basu](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arkapravab/index.html) and worked at [CSL](https://csl.csa.iisc.ac.in/). My research is primarily focussed in Computer Systems(Architecture, Operating Systems & GPU Memory Subsystem).

My thesis was about accelerating pre-processing pipelines for Deep Neural Network Training tasks to alleviate system bottlenecks (CPU / Caches / Memory / Disk) and attaining a speedup in end-to-end training. I built a Library on top of [DALI](https://developer.nvidia.com/dali) that automatically determines the underlying system properties for potential speedup opportunities, and builds pre-processing pipelines that are upto 10.5x faster that vanilla DALI pipelines. With these accelerated pre-processing pipelines, I was able to attain upto 67% end-to-end training with an H100 GPU.

Prior to joining IISc, I interned at major tech startups like <b>Innovaccer</b> and <b>Atlan</b> between 2019-2020 where I primrarily worked on ETL of data; from warehouses to UI based data-products. I used technologies like React, Django, Flutter, PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow to achieve such tasks.

My undergrad degree is from <b>USICT, GGSIPU (Dwarka)</b> where I majored in Electronics and Communications Engineering from 2017-2021
