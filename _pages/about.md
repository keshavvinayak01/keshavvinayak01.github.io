I'm a Member of Technical Staff @ [Cerebras Systems](https://www.cerebras.net/), where I work in the ML Frameworks team based out of Bangalore, India. Previously, I was a grad student @ [Department of Computer Science and Automation](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/)<b> , IISc Bangalore</b>, where I was advised by [Prof Arkaprava Basu](https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/~arkapravab/index.html) and worked at [CSL](https://csl.csa.iisc.ac.in/). My research was primarily focussed in Computer Systems(Architecture, Operating Systems & GPU Memory Subsystem).

At Cerebras, my work revolves around increasing usability and performance of systems for AI training/Inference. To this end, I've worked with MLIR/LLVM, torch-mlir, and python, amongst a lot of other frameworks. Recently, I've been working at compiler support for the underlying architecture at Cerebras, which involves multiple layers of tiered dialects and abstractions, from python, all the way down to the low-level IR supported by the chip.

At IISc, My thesis was about accelerating pre-processing pipelines for Deep Neural Network Training tasks to alleviate system bottlenecks (CPU / Caches / Memory / Disk) and attaining a speedup in end-to-end training. I built a Library on top of [DALI](https://developer.nvidia.com/dali) that automatically determines the underlying system properties for potential speedup opportunities, and builds pre-processing pipelines that are upto 10.5x faster that vanilla DALI pipelines. With these accelerated pre-processing pipelines, I was able to attain upto 67% end-to-end training with an H100 GPU.

Prior to joining IISc, I interned at major tech startups like <b>Innovaccer</b> and <b>Atlan</b> between 2019-2020 where I primrarily worked on ETL of data; from warehouses to UI based data-products. I used technologies like React, Django, Flutter, PostgreSQL, Apache Airflow to achieve such tasks.

My undergrad degree is from <b>USICT, GGSIPU (Dwarka)</b> where I majored in Electronics and Communications Engineering from 2017-2021
